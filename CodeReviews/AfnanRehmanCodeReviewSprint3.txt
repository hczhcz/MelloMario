Specific Comments on Code Quality:
The code in this class is very clean and well-organized. I noticed one small issue that would bring up a warning in code analysis, which is that the CreateGameObject
method has a large cyclomatic complexity. I do not think this can be easily avoided, but it is a concern nonetheless.The file is 106 lines long, 
which is a good length and there are not too many methods. 

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
I propose splitting up the CreateGameObject method into CreateItemObject, CreateEnemyObject, and CreateBlockObject, to reduce the cyclomatic complexity 
for the CreateGameObject class in the future. It would also make it easier to edit the creation methods for all the game objects. I see this potentially
being a hard to implement change, since there are many classes and methods dependent on this factory, so making a major change here would require changes
in other classes.
