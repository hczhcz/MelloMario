Koopa

Seperating shell from defeated would be a good idea.
As of right now when the koopa is defeated it just disapears.
Having a seperate death state with an animation where it
falls of the screen would be a good idea.

In terms of code neatness unifiying some of the if statements
into a switch would probably make the code more readable.

Seperating some of the methods in the on collision into its own
submethods would also improve code readability.
