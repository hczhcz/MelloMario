Since all of those scripts' main function is adding or deleting commands, when the game starts, we can add all the needed commands 
and then on each script class,delete unallowed commands. For example, since we are not allowed hit quit or reset when game is running, 
we can just delete exit and reset commands in playingscript. 
In constructors of both Pipeline.cs and Fireball.cs, the soundlistern are not used which can be removed.
