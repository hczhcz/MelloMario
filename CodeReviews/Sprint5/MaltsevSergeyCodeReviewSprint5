Beetle

Overall the Beetle works fairly cleanly,
the oncollide method has a high cyclomatic
complexity, however this is acceptable in
my opinion since it has to handle a lot of
different interactions.

The helmet visuals are a bit stuttery, for
now this is acceptable, since the alternative
is doubling our player sprite count.

If work on the beetle were to continue, the
next step would be clinging to ceilings and
attempting to fall on mario.

This took 10 min.
