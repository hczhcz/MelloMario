Specific Comments on Code Quality:
The SoundEffectListener class handles the playing of different sound effects from the sound effect factory using the names
of the methods where the listener is called to determine which effect to play. I feel as though some parts are 
unnecessarily confusing here, such as the togglemute function, which is already built into the XNA SoundEffect functionality. 
Other parts have a higher cyclomatic complexity due to the necessary switch statements to determine which sound instance 
to ask the factory to produce. The class is organized well, but could definitely use some restructuring or comments to 
make it more coherent or easy to understand for other people who may want to work on it.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or 
could not easily support that change:
I think an easy change would be to add some comments explaining the methods and their functions, another easy change 
would be to modify ToggleMute to use the built-in XNA mute functions to avoid essentially dubplicating code.
