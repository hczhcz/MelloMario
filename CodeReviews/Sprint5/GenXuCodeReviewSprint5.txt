Spend: 10 minutes

Code being reviewed: BaseCollidableObject.cs ans classes derived from this.
Code Author: Chenzhang, Sergey

The OnCollision is still complex. Technically, Collision should be written as events, which will make code neat.
Currently, the OnCollision usually involves with switch statement of dozens lines. Consider implementing a 
collision model(listener) that subscribe all collidable objects and define different collide results such as Hurt,
Destroy etc. Using Delegates to deal with collide response should be a better choice.
