Sprint 3

Spend: 15 minutes

Code being reviewed: Mario.cs, Goomba.cs, Koopa.cs
Code Written by: Sergey, Wenli
Switch statement for method:
	protected override void OnCollision(IGameObject target, CollisionMode mode, CornerMode corner, CornerMode cornerPassive)
has a very high complexity which needs to be reduced.
Also, bumping response should be splited into different methods if possible. Mario should not know what objects it collides with, but whether it was injured or stucked or bounced.
All response logic to different game objects should be removed from this switch statement.
Similarly for Goomba.cs and Koopa.cs, OnCollision is too complex and fat.
In the future, there suppposed to be a better model to manage the collision logic, objects will only know how they are collides instead of who with what states collide itself.

Code being reviewed: BaseCollidableObject.cs
Code Written by: Chenzhang
Switch statement for method:
Collision logic is not sufficient to manage two collisions in very short time as it will continuously return the collision mode in method:
	ScanCollideModes(Rectangle targetBoundary)
which sometimes, from the perspective of player, will cause TWO collides at same time.
For example, Koompa should become a shell after first being hitted from Top and then start moving after second collision from top.
Since the collision model is lack of ability to handle two short collision, the Koompa will start moving at "first" collision from top, which need to be improved.
