Sprint 2

Class: LevelReader
Author: All team members, mainly Sergey

This class is to read information from a text file and initialize a game level. Most of the code is good. I would suggest implementing this class as IDisposable to prevent resource leak and use a map to convert a letter in the level matrix to the corresponding GameObject type.

This review took me 10 minutes.
