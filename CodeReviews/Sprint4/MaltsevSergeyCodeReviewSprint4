Sprint 4
listener
Multiple Authors

Overall the listener is implemented quite cleanly
It is passed to all objects in the game with the base object
having several basic calls it can give such as increasing 
score and then individual items can give more specific calls
such as flagpole touches and coin collection.

This provides a clean interface between the model and the items
rather than letting the items have dirrect access to the model,
they send requests that the listener will fufill.

This can be expanded to much more than we have right now, such
as changing the model of the game or interacting with things
that would normally be outside of that item's scope.

Possible improvemnts, make the args passing more generalized
so that variable names mroe acurately reflect the values that
they are storing.

It would also be possible to consolidate some of the methods
into one, however I do not think this is needed since the
current version is adequatly user readable.
