Sprint 4

Spend: 6 minutes

Code being reviewed: SoundController.cs, GameModel.cs
Code Written by: Afnan, Chenzhang
Switch statement for method:

Considering two of them together, the SoundController.cs does not really "Controll" some thing as it's just written with
some static varibles and methods used by external, that is, the GameModel.cs, which contains a method called "SwitchMusic".
It makes the GameModel unnecessarily complex and fat. So I think this feature should be moved into SoundController and let
thet SoundController takes charge of all sound stuff.
