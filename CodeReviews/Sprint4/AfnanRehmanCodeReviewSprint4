Specific Comments on Code Quality:
The code in this class is somewhat organized and clean. It manages all of the aspects of the gameplay well. The length has grown to over 200 lines, 
making it somewhat long but not overly so. It does manage the world and HUD updates as expected. There are a few TODO comments 
but not much else in the way of explaining what certain parts of the code do. 

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
I propose changing the availability of some of the variables to allow other classes to see and make decisions based upon them. One issue ran into during 
this sprint was not being able to conveniently access variables such as time or lives to make decisions on music or win/game over states.
I also suggest making more comments for everyone to understand all parts of the code.
