Improvements:
Most game elements are unified as deriviation of IGameObject, which includes blocks, items.
It allows using a single list to iteratively call the common method like Draw() and Update().
Each block is now having its own corresponding state.
Item has a new state called Unveil which is used to progressively show the item when it comes out from brick/question blocks.
Code styles are unified, IGameObjects implemented with Base classes which share some common methods.
Iterative method is changed to avoid change elements in list during foreach iteration, with replacing by a single for loop.

Hypothetical Change:
Still, there are many style problems, including variable names, case pattern, inherited style.
The way to iteratively render (Draw) sprite is not rigorous enough.
Code readablitiy needs to be improved: single letter variable names were used in many places without any comments.
Checking state of Mario is not easy with current design, a method to check a simple Big/Small mario is needed in order to deal with brick hitting.
They will be improved in the future sprints.
