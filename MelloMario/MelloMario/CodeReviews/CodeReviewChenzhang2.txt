Name of the .cs file being reviewed:
GamePadController.cs

Author of the .cs file being reviewed:
Sergey Maltsev

Specific comments on code quality:
The use of class member "emptyInput" is likely to improve the performance, but since thumbsticks are included in "GamePadState", it will rarely be equal to the initial state as in "emptyInput".

Number of minutes taken to complete the review:
10

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
To support linear inputs (like a thumbstick) in a mario game: it is not easily support that change.
