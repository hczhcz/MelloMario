Code being reviewed: tileMap Define and LevelGen
Code Written by Sergey
Some functions are not fully done such as items inside bricks/question blocks.
Needs to be changed to json/Xml inorder to make more organizable.
Lack of hidden blocks define but eventually added by me.
Adding(reading) objects from files one by one can be optimized such as Floor rectangle from point to point which can eliminate I/O use.
