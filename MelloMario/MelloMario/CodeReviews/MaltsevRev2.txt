Sprint 2
Factorys and Level Reader
Multiple Authors

Factories:
Can be cleaned up, some of the methods overlap in functionality
for example some keys check for hold and pressed seperately, yet
the functionality for the two is effectively the same.

Some methods are outdated, in that they will not really be needed
in later sprints and as such should not be relied upon.

Error catching is not great, but it is there at a basic level.
Logging to console would improve it.

Level Reader:
The current level reader is acceptable for sprint 2.
It has its own factory is is releatively consise.

However for later sprints we will want to change to JSON
or some similar system in order to store info about blocks in a
clean manner, as o right now every instance of a block is identical.

This took 10 min.
