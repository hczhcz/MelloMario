Mario object state classes
Myself

There were too many different state classes to track, due to combining both the power and action states.
Thus, if there was a minor error, it would have to be changed across all states.

My recommendation would be to split the action state machine from the power-up state machine,
and then find a cohesive way for the two to interact.

This review took me 5-10 minutes.
