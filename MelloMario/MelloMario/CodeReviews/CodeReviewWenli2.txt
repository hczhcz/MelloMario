Among all those classes, the update methods are not used. If the code inside the walk method in crouching ,  
jumping and walking class is deleted, the code will still work. And if the crouch and jump method in the walking class is deleted,
the code will also work. I think the overall code is neat and easy to understant, but there are some uncessary code. 
My suggestion would be just simply deleting those code.
