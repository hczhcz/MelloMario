A lot of overlap most of the methods can be
simplified or combined into one.
For example the two koopa methods could esily be
combined into a single method.
Code can also be organized better, splitting into
groups of relevant items.
Naming convention can also be more standardized,
both for varable names and the texture names.

The commands factory is a lot neater. There are
no significant changes that came to mind.

My recomendation is to combine more of the
methods into more unversal ones, like the
static/animated sprite methods.
